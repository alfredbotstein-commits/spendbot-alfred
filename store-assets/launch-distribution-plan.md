**Tweet 1 Draft:**
```
Budget apps are boring.

They're spreadsheets with nicer fonts. They guilt-trip you about lattes and make you feel like a financial disaster.

I got tired of hating every expense tracker I tried, so I built one I actually wanted to use.

Meet SpendBot 🤖

**Tweet 2 Draft:**
```
SpendBot is now live on Android (iOS coming soon) 🚀

$4.99 one-time. No subscriptions. No ads. Just a snarky robot who tracks your spending and actually makes you want to open the app.

Your wallet called. It wants you to try it.

Title: I built a budget app for people who hate budget apps

Body: Hey everyone,

I've tried probably 15 different expense trackers over the years. They all had the same problem: they made me feel bad about myself.

So I made SpendBot.

It's an expense tracker with a little robot mascot who actually has personality. He celebrates when you're doing well and gently roasts you when you're not—but in a funny way, not a mean way.

What it does:
- Quick expense logging (like, actually quick)
- Budget goals without the shame
- Daily challenges and streaks
- A robot friend with opinions

What it doesn't do:
- No subscriptions ($4.99 one-time)
- No ads
- No selling your data
- No guilt trips

Available on Android (iOS coming). Would love to know what you think.

**r/personalfinance Draft (poly_trader_tx) — Comment on existing thread:**
```
Not trying to self-promote, but I literally built SpendBot for this exact pain point. Every budget app made me feel terrible, so I made one with a snarky robot sidekick that doesn't shame you.

$4.99 one-time, no subscription. Would love honest feedback from this community.
```

**r/budgetfood Draft (frugal_life_hack):**
```
Title: Built an expense tracker that actually respects your money (no subscription Required)

Body: Fellow budgeteers,

Tired of $10/month for an app that just shows you charts of what you can't afford? Same.

Built SpendBot — a one-time $4.99 expense tracker with personality. The robot mascot celebrates wins, doesn't shame you for spending, and has actual opinions.

Daily challenges + streaks to build habits. Works offline. No ads.

What's your favorite budget app that doesn't cost $100/year?
```

**r/frugal Draft (frugal_life_hack):**
```
Title: $4.99 forever — built a no-subscription expense tracker

Body: Sharing because this community gets it:

I refuse to pay monthly for an expense tracker. That's counterproductive.

SpendBot is $4.99 one-time. That's it. No premium tier. No "unlock more features."

Robot buddy tracks your spending, sends gentle nudges, gamifies daily tracking. Basically Duolingo energy but for your wallet.

No ads, works offline. Android for now, iOS soon.
